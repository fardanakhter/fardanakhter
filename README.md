### Hi there 🤓

I'm Fardan Akhter, a Software Engineer (iOS) from Pakistan 🇵🇰.

I'm a 5+ years experienced engineer creating iOS mobile apps with command on Swift / Objective C. I have successfully published around 20+ apps to App Store in domains like fitness training, educational, sports clubs, social networking, gaming skins, crypto wallet, ride-hailing etc. Currently selling freelance services and counted in top 10% of talents with 100% job success score [@Upwork](https://github.com/upwork).

Previously, I played a key role in building 3rd party framework for event reporting and analytics named as [PJDSDK](https://docs.pumpjackdataworks.com/ios) [@PumpjackDataworks](https://github.com/Tixsee).

I'm fascinated by well maintained projects, learning ways that improve app performance and user experience and also have worked on projects that have a large user-base like [Drop In Fortnite](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drop-in-for-fortnite-app/id1357883503) and [Intermiami](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/inter-miami-cf/id1492007038).

Outside of work, I'm interested in styudying state-of-the-art practices and solving tricky leetcode problems. In My spare time you can find me playing guitar 🎸 and spending time creating digital art 🖌.

Catch me on
